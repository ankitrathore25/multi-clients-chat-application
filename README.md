# multi-clients-chat-application
Multiple clients-server chat application built in java swing. It supports message delivery to the offline clients and vector clock implementation.

This project was based on my learning in course CSE-5306 Distributed System.
It was developed in 3 phases. In each phase I have implemented different concepts of Distributed System.
