# multi-clients-chat-application

Phase 1:
In this phase, I have implemented simple multiple clients - server application which support Unicasting, Multicasting and Broadcasting of the messages based on different options available on the UI.

 Code Structure:

Each phase contains 3 files. 
- ServerView.java - It contains code for server. This class must be run first.
- loginClient.java - It contains code for client's login and run after the server has been started. It can be run as many number of times depending upon number of clients required.
- ClientView.java - It contains code for the client.
